React Hot Or Not
================

A simple React component that allows the user to swipe images to the left to say "not hot" and right to say "hot". It puts a little rotation on the image along the way and hilights the hot or not buttons as a kind of side bonus.

Apparently this is similar to Tinder, though being married I can't say.
